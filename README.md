# Detection of Hate Speech on Social Media

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
Developed a machine learning system to **classify social media comments as hate speech or not**, helping platforms detect and prevent harmful content.

## ðŸ›  How It Works  
- Preprocessed 100k+ comments using **text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization**.  
- Applied **TF-IDF vectorization** and **SMOTE** to balance the dataset.  
- Trained and tuned **SVM** and **Random Forest** models with hyperparameter optimisation.  

## ðŸ“ˆ Impact & Results  
- Achieved **92% model accuracy**.  
- Demonstrated scalable pipeline for real-time moderation use cases.  
- Potential to significantly reduce harmful content exposure on online platforms.  

## ðŸ—‚ Tech Stack  
Python â€¢ NLTK â€¢ Scikit-learn (SVM, Random Forest) â€¢ pandas â€¢ Matplotlib
